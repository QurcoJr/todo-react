The project took me no more then a day. I cannot emphasize any pieces that took long cause the functionality was very straightforward for me. I spent most of the time on styling things.

First of all I decided to go with CRA template, I created new React app, secondly I chose to use styled-components and checked library's docs. Since there is not mentioned routing in the assignment requirements I decided to not to use React-router, instead I conditionally render pages dependent on if user is logged in or not. If there will be new pages added in the future, project will need routing for sure. Then I added some global styles, after that I started to create Login page and hooked up an API call. I implemented auth functionality and then I started working on todo list page. I created custom hook to persist state in localStorage. Divided todo page into multiple components. After I finished all the functionality of the app I started to style the app. I created custom components with styled components and then I used them. I made sure that the app also looked nice on mobile size and that was it, DONE!
